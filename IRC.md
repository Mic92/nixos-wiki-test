We are on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) via `#nixos` on `irc.freenode.net`. Come join us!

About the channel
-----------------

The NixOS IRC channel is populated by both developers and users.

If you need help installing NixOS or getting a package to work, you will usually get your questions answered in here.

Joining channels
----------------

If your IRC client can follow links: [chat.freenode.net](irc://chat.freenode.net/nixos).

Principles
----------

The \#nixos channel should always be friendly and welcoming, especially to newbies. Design discussions, which to outsiders often look like flame wars or heated arguments, should happen on \#nixos-in-depth. But learning the ins and outs of NixOS is good and should be encouraged on \#nixos. Comparisons to other package managers are also allowed, although nonconstructive criticism is not allowed.

### \#nixos code of conduct

Because people use NixOS for widely differing purposes, from servers farms to desktops to embedded systems, almost any computer-related question is on-topic in \#nixos. However, some other topics are not appropriate. The following rules are suggested to keep things civil between people with different goals and priorities. They can generally be summarized as "Be patient, take a break, and spread knowledge, not insults."

-   Zero tolerance for ridiculing questions or insulting new users. New users should feel entirely comfortable asking questions. They are not necessarily guaranteed a good answer though. Negative comments and ambiguous questions should be dealt with by asking for more details, e.g. using the [Socratic method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method)). Challenging or insulting the asker with ad-hominem attacks is never allowed.

<!-- -->

-   We do not tolerate harassment of users in any form. Harassment includes offensive comments or images related to gender or anything to do with it (identity, history, expression, non-binary gender, etc.), sexuality or anything to do with it (e.g. sexual orientation), disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, programming experience or background, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or recording, sustained disruption of the channel (e.g. flooding), inappropriate private messaging, oe unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any behavior are expected to comply immediately.

<!-- -->

-   All participants are subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, participants should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

<!-- -->

-   If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the community staff immediately. Community staff can be identified by using `/msg ChanServ access #NixOS list`.

Participants violating these rules may be warned, kicked, or banned, as deemed appropriate by the operators. The operators may also contact local law enforcement if necessary.

History
-------

`#nixos` has been around for a few years. Eelco first registered it in February of 2008. The channel gained persistent logging starting in September 2009.

Additional channels
-------------------

The only other NixOS channel is `##nix-darwin<code>, also on <code>irc.freenode.net`. It is specifically for making *Nix* work better on Macs.

Bots and Logs
-------------

There are a couple bots in `#nixos`.

\[0__0\]
The [botbot.me logbot](https://botbot.me). It collects our logs in both [text](https://nixos.org/irc/logs/) and [web-app](https://botbot.me/freenode/nixos/) accessible forms.

NixOS_Github
This bot will enter the channel, and announce commits and pull requests into the various [NixOS repositories](https://github.com/nixos/).

Bots
----

`[0__0]` is the botbot.me logbot. NixOS is the NixOS bot, who currently only does logs (I think). There is also a Github bot, NixOS_Github, which announces the commits to various NixOS repositories.
