To install firefox, I did not use "firefoxWrapper", but "firefox-with-plugins". It seems that the name of the packages was changed.

Note the "A" used in the examples with nix-env, that specifies to use the "attribute path" rather than the package name. [Goibhniu](/User:Goibhniu "wikilink") ([talk](/User_talk:Goibhniu "wikilink")) 21:00, 14 July 2014 (CEST)
