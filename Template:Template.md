<noinclude>

**A special template for use in *all* template pages.**

#### Usage

This template should be added at the very beginning of all template pages between 'noinclude' tags:

<noinclude>`{{Template}}`</noinclude>

A brief description of the template, usage instructions, and output example should also be added between the 'noinclude' tags (as in this template).

The template wikitext must be written between 'includeonly' tags:

<includeonly>`...`</includeonly>

#### Example

</noinclude><includeonly>

<div class="toc" style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
This page is a template. It contains no NixOS-related information, but should be used as part of other articles. For more information, read [Help:Template](/Help:Template "wikilink").

If you want to edit this template, copy the text to [Template:Sandbox](/Template:Sandbox "wikilink"), edit and test it there, and copy it back when it works.
