As you may have noticed I've included a single reference to a command line named **cut**. I want to continue to add examples of it's functions untill all of the options are exhausted, then find a pattern of which to make the abstraction of each function easier to list, illustrate and therefor to comprehend.

I make no bones about this being a sort of "cheatsheet" for my self, in ways. But if I didn't make this page for my self, then who would use it? To get to the point I want the community to also add nifty little verbose cheat sheets for certain commands for personal and general consumption.

Not everyone have all the commands in their memory off-hand and therefor it leaves you very much frustrated having to open man pages and such for this, that and the other. By creating this "cheat-sheet" we can also use it as a reference point for the rest of the wiki, so that if a command is mentioned in some page we could potentially put in a javascript that would parse this and also add a reference link to the cheatsheet. So I want to start facilitating a part of the automatic wiki and documentation process with this little page, as both a reference point for my self, and for everything I intend to write in form of command lines.

So, won't you join me?
