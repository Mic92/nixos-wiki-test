Introduction
------------

We have a table at FOSDEM 2015, which happens in **Brussels** during the **Jan 31** weekend, free entrance, come if you can. The table is meant to show off the project to people that walk through the hallway and as a meeting point for socializing ("real life irc"). Here's what that looks like: [300px](/File:Fosdem2013-booth.jpeg "wikilink")

We need **volunteers** to man the table from 9:30 to 18:00, **gear** for the table, a **presentation** and **swag**.

Volunteers
----------

Please add yourself by editing the below tables; just remove the ***nobody*** and put your name/nick, separate with commas. More is better - please add yourself to all the timeslots you'd be willing to assist in. For each slot we need two volunteers. If we have more than two, they can decide at the time who does what.

</table>
Table
-----

We will need two monitors and something to drive them.

-   One would be playing a presentation (to be made by somebody, or is there a nice one already?) explaining Nix
-   One is for showing interested people how NixOS works. This would be done by a table host who is typically behind the table so it's nice to have a mirrored screen

Great extras: Banners, flyers, swag, t-shirts, nerdy things, 3D-printed items, ... Anything goes really.

</table>
### Table hosts

The hosts will be explaining Nix\* to interested people passing by the stand. Good things to show:

-   How a broken configuration.nix simply doesn't let you switch the system
-   How fast a rollback is
-   `ls -lR /bin /usr`

If we have stuff for sale, they would also need to handle that and safeguard the cashbox.

Swag
----

It would be great if we have swag to give away/sell. There is apparently some money left over from the Ljubjana sprint. A volunteer to drive this would be great.

If we can give e.g. USB sticks away, we could have a contest with a few prize drawings (have them fill out a google form with some questions about NixOS that they would have to look up), or we could give something to people that do a pull request while at FOSDEM.

USB sticks with logo prints are super cheap, even in 32GB versions (around $10, search for "usb flash logo" on aliexpress but mind the shipping time).

For the fans, it's nice to be able to buy t-shirts with the logo.

Dinner on Saturday Evening
--------------------------

We could arrange a meeting place and time and find something on the way (like last year).
