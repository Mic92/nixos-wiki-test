Dotfiles
--------

### aszlig

[1](https://github.com/aszlig/vuizvui) “This is a set of NixOS modules/configs which I use for my personal machines, with a focus on patching most "dotfiles" directly into the packages and thus using dotfiles only for experimenting/testing.”

### auntie

[2](https://github.com/auntieNeo/nixrc) "A different approach to aszlig, with similar results: NixOS config in sync with the dotfiles. Here it is done by putting the NixOS config in the dotfile repo"
