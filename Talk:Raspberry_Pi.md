Has anyone used the nixos image on a Raspberry Pi Model-B ?

I tried the image from the magnet link (nixos-raspberrypi-ef28e8e70e96-0236cc5d8826-sd2g.img), but it does not boot on my Raspberry Pi Model-B. I get no display at all. Unfortunately I do not have a breakout board for it (I should have got one), so I cannot look for serial console output during boot. The same machine boots raspbian okay.

The sha1sum on my nixos-raspberrypi-ef28e8e70e96-0236cc5d8826-sd2g.img is f3034a6ebecacd8fccbf3c180cb210f83127da00 .
