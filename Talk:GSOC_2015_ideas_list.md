Guidelines
==========

Every idea should have:

-   descriptive title
-   motivation (How does this benefit NixOS?)
-   detailed *description* of the task and *scope* (What will the student do?)
-   contact (email, irc) (Who will help the student?)
-   required skills/languages (What does the student already need to know?)

The description should be *specific* and *constructive*. We are proposing projects for students to invest their time and for our sponsor to invest their money. Giving specific details of what each idea entails demonstrates good planning. Use constructive language to emphasize that we are trying to build something great. Avoid being critical of other projects. Brief, motivating criticism is fine, e.g. "Existing approaches to X have difficulty Y. We can improve on this by Z." If your description is mostly criticism of other projects, rewrite it: no one is going to pay a student to tear down other projects.
