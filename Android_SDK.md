Android SDK
===========

**TODO:** Introduction to the Android SDK.

Installation
------------

Currently there is no Nix expression for the Android SDK in Nixpkgs. However, you can install the SDK manually. Refer to the official instructions \[1\].

While it would probably be easy to create a Nix expression with some knowledge of the Android SDK this hasn't been done yet.

Usage
-----

Currently the Android SDK's GUI is broken on NixOS with the manual installation. However, there is the -u option which allows you to use the SDK's command line interface.

**TODO:** How can you install tools, platforms and packages?
