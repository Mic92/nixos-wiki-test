Use this template to mark pages that needs deleting. This will make the page appear in [:Category:Deletion required](/:Category:Deletion_required "wikilink").

**Use only on spambots-created page or on completely irrelevant pages.**

It is considered rude to delete *real* content. Please see [Help:Sysop deleting and undeleting](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Sysop_deleting_and_undeleting#When_not_to_delete_a_page), the section *When not to delete a page* explains common scenarios.

As a quick reference:

-   Merge duplicate contents in a single page and use a redirection
-   Never delete a redirect
-   Use [Template:Out_of_date](/Template:Out_of_date "wikilink") for out of date contents.
