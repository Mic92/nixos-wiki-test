The intention of this page is to create a proposal for a style guide. If accepted, this can be used by anyone who would like to create materials for Nix related projects: t-shirts, flyers, banners etc.

**This is not meant to be used by "Style Police" or to hamper creativity!**

A style guide can be used to create templates and provide inspiration for people. It should make it easier for people with little design skills or knowledge to create materials which are visually consistent with the concepts and strengths of Nix related projects. Ideally, one will be able to draw from the guidelines without the need to think through everything from scratch. It should answer questions such as "what colors should I use on a black background?", "What font should I use in a flyer?", "What types of images would be suitable for a brochure?". With a strong and clear identity, it should be obvious to a casual observer of any material that it is related to Nix and should echo the values and that the project represents.

Currently, this is merely a collection of ideas and proposals and has no official status whatsoever.

Logo

We need more consistent colors across displays and print, a black and white version of the logo would also be useful.
