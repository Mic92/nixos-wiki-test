-   [Zalora](http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1y2vx8/nixos_added_to_distrowatch_after_7_years_on/cfh4we4): Using it internally and preparing to use it in production ([they're hiring!](http://jobs.engineering.zalora.com/apply/DHuzeh/Global-DevOps-Lead))
-   [RhodeCode](https://rhodecode.com/blog/rhodecode-nix-package-manager): Using it as a build tool (also on cygwin) and for internal servers ([need a nix job?](http://rhodecode.workable.com))
-   [Flying Circus](http://blog.flyingcircus.io/2015/11/09/announcing-our-new-nixos-based-platform-generation/): Using it as services platform for customers. Flying Circus moves from Gentoo to NixOS during 2016.
