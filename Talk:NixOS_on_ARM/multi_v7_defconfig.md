Hi!I'm interested in getting NixOS running, or at least playing with it, on the BeagleBone Black (Rev C) and the ASUS RT-AC68U. Can someone here explain to me what this page has to do with NixOS in particular?--[Pxc](/User:Pxc "wikilink") ([talk](/User_talk:Pxc "wikilink")) 02:40, 6 December 2015 (UTC)
